# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# Return the indices of the two numbers as an array [index1, index2] of length 2.
# You must use exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# Your solution must use only constant extra space (no hashmaps).
