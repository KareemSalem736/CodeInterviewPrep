Welcome back ‚Äî and well done finishing **Two Sum** on your own! That‚Äôs one of the best building blocks you can have. Since your goal is to **master a focused set of ‚Äúbread & butter‚Äù DSA patterns** for interviews (especially targeting AWS and similar companies), here‚Äôs a clear plan:

---

## üîë Phase 1: Bread & Butter Patterns to Master First

These cover 80%+ of what you‚Äôll see in interviews.

### 1. **Hashmap Patterns** (You're already started!)

* ‚úÖ Two Sum (done!)
* üîÅ Practice: [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/), [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
* Bonus: [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

### 2. **Two Pointers & Sorting**

* Pattern: Sort, then use left/right pointers for scanning or comparisons
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
  * [Two Sum II (sorted)](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
  * [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
  * [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) (geometry twist)

### 3. **Sliding Window**

* Dynamic window to maintain a condition or max/min
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
  * [Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)
  * [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

### 4. **Stack**

* For problems involving:

  * "Next greater element"
  * Balanced brackets
  * Monotonic stack patterns
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
  * [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
  * [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

## üìö Phase 2: Core Data Structures to Know Just Enough

Once you‚Äôre confident with above patterns, add:

### 5. **Binary Search**

* Even outside arrays! Used in searching over "answer space"
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
  * [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)
  * [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### 6. **Basic Recursion / Backtracking**

* Not full-blown dynamic programming yet
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
  * [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
  * [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

### 7. **Heap / Priority Queue**

* For "top k" or scheduling problems
* ‚≠ê Problems:

  * [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
  * [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

## üß† Mindset to Build Mastery

* **Solve one problem per pattern fully on your own**, then repeat similar ones
* Aim for **5‚Äì10 problems per pattern**, but start with **one at a time**
* **Explain aloud** why the algorithm works ‚Äî interviewers love reasoning
* For now, **skip tree/graph/dp** unless you finish the above ‚Äî those are great, but not your highest ROI just yet.
